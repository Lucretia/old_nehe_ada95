package Camera is

  -- The camera is used to simplify the modelling & viewing process, it should do the following:
  -- + Provide a way to move the camera (viewing).
  -- + Project the world into the window.
  -- Normally, in OpenGL, the camera transforms are applied first, and then each model's transforms are applied, then the model is
  -- rendered. This can be achieved by having the camera set it's position into the modelview matrix first as normal before the model's matrix?

      -- Create the up vector again
      -- Then compose a 3x3 matrix from the 3 axes.
