* Change the package hierarchy to:

  gl.ads       - The thick bindings to OpenGL
  gl-c.ads     - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to OpenGL
  gl-ext.ads   - The thick bindings to OpenGL Extensions
  gl-ext-c.ads - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to OpenGL Extensions
  glu.ads      - The thick bindings to GLU
  glu-c.ads    - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to GLU
  glut.ads     - The thick bindings to GLUT
  glut-c.ads   - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to GLUT
  glx.ads      - The thick bindings to GLX
  glx-c.ads    - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to GLX
  wgl.ads      - The thick bindings to WGL
  wgl-c.ads    - The C interface, i.e. thin bindings to WGL

  This way AdaGL can export both a thin and thick set of bindings which the user can select which set of bindings to use.

* Take the support to OpenGL 1.5.

* Add support for Cg.

* Add support for GLSL.

* Port the red book samples.

* Add lib linking pragmas to their own packages in their own directories, e.g.

  linux/gnat/gl-link.ads
  win32/gnat/gl-link.ads
  win32/objectada/gl-link.ads
  etc.

  This needs to be done on a per library basis, GL, GLU, GLUT, etc.

* Move the import pragma's to a separate package, e.g. Win32 requires DLL linkage and Linux requires C linkage.
